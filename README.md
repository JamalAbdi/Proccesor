A simple processor in VHDL

The processor is equiped with and Arithamtic Logic Unit, two latches a fintite state machine, a contrul unit
a 4x16 decoder and 7-seg for the output

The code is implemented on a FGPA board

It can do various tasks including shifting, inverting, creating the 2's compliment of an 8 bit binary numebr.
